# Rock . . . Paper . . . Scissors!

A couple of years ago I created a GitHub Profile that went by the name of WebacyByChristine. Since then, I've learnt a lot more when it comes to programming, but I still wanted to share my older projects that I did to learn the basics of Javascript (I also lost my email address since then, oops!). This is a basic (yet functioning) Rock Paper Scissors Game that I made with Javascript, and in this game you can play against the computer again and again - good luck!
